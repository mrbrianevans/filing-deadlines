# How subscriptions work

Filing Deadlines operates with a Software-as-a-Service model, where users pay a monthly fee to use the
system.

Subscription plans apply to an Organisation on Filing Deadlines. This means that any users with access
to the organisation will have access to the features included with the subscription plan.

Only the user who created the organisation can start, change or end the subscription plan for that organisation.

The different plans offer different features and limits or quotas for some of the features, which can
be viewed on the [pricing page](/view/pricing).

## Trials
When you initially sign up to Filing Deadlines (sign in for the first time) and create an organisation,
you automatically get access to some paid-for features for free for the first few days. This is the 
evaluation period, for you to see the dashboards and determine if they are what you're looking for.

After the evaluation period, you need to choose a subscription plan to sign up for. The Standard plan
offers 30 days for free before you start paying, but you need to enter your payment details when you choose the plan.

You can manage your subscription at any time by going to the [Manage Organisation](/secure/manage-organisation) 
page and clicking `Manage billing`. Here you are able to change which plan you are subscribed to,
change your payment details, view past invoices, or cancel your plan altogether.
