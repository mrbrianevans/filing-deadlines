# Privacy policy


# Data stored

## Client list data
We do not share your client list with anyone, unless you explicitly invite another user to your
Filing Deadlines "organisation".
Only users that you invite to your organisation will have access to your client data.

## Registered address data
You can optionally enter your registered office address if you would like to view companies which are 
registered there. This user entered data remains private to your organisation.

## Organisation name
When you create an organisation on Filing Deadlines, you have to give it a name. 
This is used for when you invite other users to join, so that they can identify the organisation.

## Sign in details
When you sign in with Xero, we receive certain information from Xero such as your name and email address.
This does not contain your Xero password, and we have no access to your Xero account or organisation.

When you sign in with Auth0 (usually via email and password), we receive your email address, but not your password. 

## Data storage
Your data is stored securely in our database, and is not accessible to the public internet.
